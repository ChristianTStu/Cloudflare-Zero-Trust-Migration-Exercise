# Cloudflare Zero Trust Migration Exercise

Welcome to the Cloudflare Zero Trust Migration Exercise repository. This project involves transitioning a web application from an on-premises environment to the cloud using Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform. Below you will find detailed instructions on setting up your environment, configuring access controls, and submitting proof of your configuration.

## Overview of Cloudflare Zero Trust

Cloudflare Zero Trust offers a comprehensive security framework that enables secure access to resources in the cloud. By using Cloudflare, you can implement identity and access management policies to control who can access your web applications based on verified credentials.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have a basic understanding of cloud concepts and identity access management (IAM) principles.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Cloudflare Account:**
- Sign up for a free account at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). This account will be used to manage your Zero Trust settings and web application.

2. **Set Up Cloudflare Zero Trust:**
- Navigate to the Zero Trust section in your Cloudflare dashboard and begin setting up your environment.

3. **Create an IAM Policy:**
- Develop an IAM policy within Cloudflare Zero Trust. This policy should use Google credentials (or other supported authentication methods) to control access to your web application assets.

## Verification

4. **Deploy Web Application:**
- Move your on-premises web application to Cloudflare by updating DNS settings and configuring cloud-based delivery and security features.

5. **Test Access Control:**
- Validate the IAM policy by testing access with Google credentials. Ensure that access is granted or denied according to the rules you have set.

## Submission

6. **Capture and Submit Screenshots:**
- Take a screenshot of your Cloudflare dashboard showing the Zero Trust configuration.
- Capture the IAM policy settings page.
- Take a screenshot of the Google credentials integration.
- Capture the DNS settings page showing the migration of your web application.
- Provide evidence of the web application running in the cloud (webpage screenshot).
- Take a screenshot of a successful access control test using Google credentials.
